## Step 1: Create Your S3 Bucket and Upload Movie Data

### What this step does:
- Creates a personal S3 bucket for you
- You'll upload a small movie metadata file to this bucket

See the CF Template for this step [here](./template.yml).

### 1. Deploy the S3 stack:
From the project root folder, run:

```bash
./deploy.sh step1-s3
```

This will create a bucket named like: `movie-data-bucket-123456789012-ap-southeast-2`

To test it you can either locate the bucket via AWS Console or by running this script:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name step1-s3 \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='BucketName'].OutputValue" \
  --output text
```

Press on `q` to exit the view.

### 2. Upload the dataset to the bucket

In real life scenario the file is being dropped to the bucket by another system. But for the demo purpose we drop it ourselves.

#### Option A: Upload via AWS Console

```bash
aws s3 cp data/movies_metadata.csv \
  s3://<your-bucket-name>/raw/movies/
```

Example:

```bash
aws s3 cp data/movies_metadata.csv \
  s3://movie-data-bucket-123456789012-ap-southeast-2/raw/movies/
```

> ðŸ’¡ Using an object key like raw/movies/movies_metadata.csv instead of uploading directly to the bucket root helps organise data into logical "folders" making it easier to manage, automate, and query in tools like AWS Glue or Athena. It also supports better permission control and aligns with best practices for building scalable data pipelines.

#### Option B: Upload via AWS Console

1. Go to your Amazon S3 and locate the bucekt.
2. Click Upload
3. Create or choose a folder path: raw/movies/
4. Upload [the file](../../data/movies_metadata.csv) from this repository.

### 3. Check the file is in the bucket

#### Option A: Check via AWS CLI

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-name>/raw/movies/
```

Example:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://movie-data-bucket-123456789012-ap-southeast-2/raw/movies/
```

You should see `movies_metadata.csv` listed in the output.

#### Option B: Check via AWS Console

1. Go to your Amazon S3 and locate your bucket.
2. Navigate to the `raw/movies/` folder.
3. Confirm that `movies_metadata.csv` appears in the list of files.

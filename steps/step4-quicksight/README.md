# Step 4: Create a QuickSight Dashboard

> **Amazon QuickSight** is a cloud-native business intelligence tool that lets you build interactive dashboards directly from AWS data sources like S3, Athena, or Redshift.
>
> üí° Think of it as: _‚ÄúExcel meets Tableau ‚Äî but native to AWS and serverless.‚Äù_

## 1. Set Up Your QuickSight Account

1. Go to the [QuickSight Console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com)
2. Click **‚ÄúSign up for QuickSight‚Äù**
3. Choose the **Standard or Enterprise edition** (you can start with a 30 days free trial)
4. Enter your preferred **notification email**
5. Under **QuickSight account name**, enter: `movie-insights`
6. Select your region (e.g., **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** / `ap-southeast-2`)
7. Choose the **QuickSight-managed role** (default)
8. Grant access to your **S3 bucket**: `movie-data-bucket-<account-id>-<region>`
9. Deselect any optional add-ons

‚è≥ **Wait 2‚Äì5 minutes** for your account to be provisioned.

## 2. Connect to the Cleaned S3 Data in QuickSight!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can deploy some QuickSight resources via CloudFormation, but support is limited. For now, we'll configure the resources manually.

For the S3 connector, QuickSight uses a manifest file to locate your data and understand how to interpret it. You‚Äôll need to prepare this file first.
In the `step4-quicksight` folder, there is a file named `quicksight-movie-manifest.json`. Replace <account-id> with your actual AWS account ID. Once updated, the manifest file will be ready for use.

Let's connect to S3:
1. In the QuickSight console, go to [Datasets](https://ap-southeast-2.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/start/data-sets)
2. Create a new dataset
3. Choose S3 as a source
4. Enter a name: `CleanedMoviesData` (or any other name you like for your source)
5. Under Manifest file path, change from URL to Upload option
6. Select the manifest file we just updated.
7. Once uploaded - click on `Visualize` to start building.

## 3. Build Your Dashboard in QuickSight

Once your dataset is imported and loaded, it's time to explore and visualise your data!

Here are a few ideas for charts and insights you can build:

#### Popular Genres by Count

- **Visual type**: Pie or bar chart
- **X-axis**: `genre`
- **Value**: `none` (picks count of records)

This helps you see which genres appear most frequently in your dataset.

#### Top Spoken Languages

- **Visual type**: Pie or bar chart
- **Dimension**: `spoken_languages`
- **Value**: `none` (picks count of records)
- **Filter**: Pick the most common languages

Identify which languages dominate the movie dataset.

#### Average Popularity by Genre

- **Visual type**: Horizontal bar or heatmap
- **Group by**: `genre`
- **Metric**: `avg(popularity)` (be careful, defaults to Sum)

Helps surface which genres trend as the most "popular" overall.

### Save Your Dashboard

Once your visuals are created:

1. Click "Publish"
2. Name it: Movie Insights Dashboard
3. After publishing, you can even **share dashboards** with teammates or export them as PDFs.

The workshop is complete ‚Äî congratulations! You‚Äôve successfully built a data analytics pipeline! üöÄ
